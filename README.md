# Heimdall Controller (WIP)

Structure your REST requests by communicating with [Heimdall Contracts](https://github.com/ikaru5/heimdall-contract).
Target is to encapsulate your asynchronous AJAX and WebSocket requests and responses for better maintainability.

This is still in development... More to come!

- [ ] add tests
- [ ] write README :D
